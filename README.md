# Team 2.4 RP Warehouse Repo

## General Information
* Branches are created for developing features, these can be made for
  group development of a feature, or individually. These should be able to
  be merged into master when we get close to a deadline 
* The repository is split into two modules, rp-warehouse-nxt and rp-warehouse-pc,
  you can just ignore the one that you are not working on
* Never submit a merge request to master with code that won't compile or breaks
  at runtime
* The test directory in rp-warehouse-pc should mirror the package structure of main
* When creating a feature, create an appropriate package(s) under the given
  package structure
